# Room Automation System using Cisco Packet Tracer

## Aim
To design and simulate a **Room Automation System** using Cisco Packet Tracer, capable of automatically controlling a **fan and lamp** based on temperature and light sensor readings, with remote IoT monitoring.

---

## Results
- Fan automatically switches **ON** when temperature > 30Â°C  
- Lamp automatically switches **ON** when light intensity < threshold  
- Remote monitoring & control successfully achieved using Cisco Packet Tracer IoT interface
